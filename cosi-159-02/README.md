# COSI-159A: Deep Learning Practice

COSI-159A: Computer Vision, 2023 Spring  
Code template on Sphereface

To run the training code

```
python main.py
```

The training result:
```
Epoch: [1/10]; Time: 58.49; Loss: 13.0214
Epoch: [2/10]; Time: 58.72; Loss: 5.1145
Epoch: [3/10]; Time: 58.38; Loss: 2.8784
Epoch: [4/10]; Time: 52.30; Loss: 2.5471
Epoch: [5/10]; Time: 52.37; Loss: 2.5637
Epoch: [6/10]; Time: 53.02; Loss: 2.7058
Epoch: [7/10]; Time: 52.99; Loss: 2.8097
Epoch: [8/10]; Time: 53.60; Loss: 2.8717
Epoch: [9/10]; Time: 55.51; Loss: 2.9344
Epoch: [10/10]; Time: 52.55; Loss: 2.9506
```

To run the testing code
```
python main.py --eval 1
```

But the accuracy is low, only around 51%
